# PythonRandomName
 A basic random name generator built in Python. It is intended for use in deciding a "secret santa" style gifting arrangement. 

 There are two key features to the logic:

 1. The gifter cannot match the recipient (no self gifting)
 2. The gifter cannot be the recipient for the person they draw (no direct swaps)

 main.py runs fully in CLI and prints the results to terminal in plaintext

 prettyMain.py takes user input through CLI, but opens a basic window to display the output in a prettier manner

 You cannot retrieve old draws, so if it matters to you then please make sure you log your results.
